#Sudoku Solver
A simple Sudoku solver that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any 9x9 Sudoku grid. The solver fills in the missing numbers while ensuring that the Sudoku rules are followed:

- Each row contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
- Each column contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
- Each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
How It Works
The solver uses a backtracking algorithm. The process works as follows:

1. Find an empty cell:

- The algorithm scans the grid for the first empty cell (represented by 0).
2. Try placing a number:

- Starting from 1, the algorithm attempts to place a number in the empty cell.
3. Check if the number is valid:

- The number must not exist in the same row.
- The number must not exist in the same column.
- The number must not exist in the same 3x3 subgrid.
4. Recursively solve the next cell:

- If the current number is valid, the algorithm moves on to the next empty cell.
- If the entire grid is filled, the puzzle is solved!
5. Backtrack if needed:

- If no valid number can be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks by removing the last placed number and trying the next possible number.
This process continues until the puzzle is solved or determined to be unsolvable.
