Sudoku Solver
This is a simple Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the missing numbers of a 9x9 Sudoku grid. The solver ensures that the solution follows the rules of Sudoku:

Each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each row.
Each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each column.
Each number from 1 to 9 appears only once in each 3x3 subgrid.
How It Works
The Sudoku solver uses the following steps:

Find an empty cell: The algorithm scans the grid for the first empty cell (represented by 0).

Try a number: Starting with 1, it tries to place a number in the empty cell.

Check if the number is valid:

The number must not already exist in the same row.
The number must not already exist in the same column.
The number must not already exist in the 3x3 subgrid that contains the cell.
Recursively try the next cell:

If the current number is valid, the algorithm recursively tries to solve the next empty cell.
If all cells are filled, the puzzle is solved!
Backtrack if needed:

If a number doesn't lead to a solution, the algorithm backtracks, removes the number from the current cell, and tries the next possible number.
This process continues until the puzzle is solved or no solution is found.
